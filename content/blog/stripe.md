### My Work
For my 12 weeks on Stripe, I was a crew member of the Connect Platform Billing 
and Monetization team which covers a whole breadth of work across domains across 
the company. My responsibility for the summer was the GA (General Availability) 
launch for our team's new and highly-asked for [Platform Pricing Tools](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools) product. This task entailed fullstack development in 
the Connect Dashboard and thorough feature testing along with collaboration with
our Product Manager. 

More coming soon...
