#### Overview

[GailBot](https://sites.tufts.edu/hilab/gailbot/#overview) is an open-source transcription tool developed to convert audio files into text using automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology. As part of my work on the project, I was responsible for writing testing suites to ensure the tool's accuracy and performance, updating the GUI to improve user experience, and integrating different machine learning models for enhanced transcription capabilities. My contributions helped streamline the transcription process and ensure that the software is both robust and user-friendly.

#### Tech Stack
The project was built and deployed using:
- Python
- PyQt for the GUI
